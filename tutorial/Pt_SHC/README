This example shows how to calculate dynamical spin Hall conductivity of Pt
from .eig, .amn, .mmn, and .spn files. Run ./execute-example to plot the real parts.

1) mmn2uHu.py
    The module mmn2uHu is able to make .sHu and .sIu files used to calculate Ryoo's
    spin Hall conductivity(RPS 2019), from .mmn and .spn.
    For details, see http://wannier-berri.org/documentation.html#sec-mmn2uhu
    This is less accurate than direct calculation of .sHu and .sIu by
    pw2wannier90.x

2) wannier90.x
    To execute this, it is required first to have Wannier90 installed.
    generate the .chk file.

3) WANNIERBERRI
    make dynamical spin Hall conductivity data using Wannier interpolation.
    "opt_SHCqiao"(QZYZ 2018) and "opt_SHCryoo"(RPS 2019) are different
    in how to obtain spin-current matrix elements under the Wannier gauge.
    Also. opt_SHCqiao only requires .eig, .mmn, and .spn files while
    opt_SHCryoo also requires .sHu and .sIu.

4) gnuplot
    plot the real parts of the two types of SHC.
