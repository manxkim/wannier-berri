1) scf -> nscf -> wannier90 pp -> pw2wannier90
    These process make bloch wavefunctions and their velocity and
    spin-current matrix elements. .eig, .mmn, .spn, .sHu, and .sIu are them.
    They are used to initiallize the system(wannierberri.System_w90)
    
2) wannier90.x
    To execute this, it is required first to have Wannier90 installed.
    generate the .chk file.

3) WANNIERBERRI
    make spin Hall conductivity data using Wannier interpolation.
    "opt_SHCqiao"(QZYZ 2018) and "opt_SHCryoo"(RPS 2019) are different
    in how to obtain spin-current matrix elements under the Wannier gauge.
    Also. opt_SHCqiao only requires .eig, .mmn, and .spn files while
    opt_SHCryoo also requires .sHu and .sIu.

4) gnuplot
    plot the real parts of the two types of SHC.
